# Teaching materials for phylogenetic analysis and related topics
Here are some scripts and teaching materials for phylogenetic analysis and related topics.  

See the exercise on the root-to-tip analysis here: [Root-to-tip](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=Root-to-tip.html)  
And the exercise on plotting trees with ggtree here: [Plotting_trees_with_ggtree.html](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=Plotting_trees_with_ggtree.html)

The exercises are based on sequence data from [this Bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA809886/)
